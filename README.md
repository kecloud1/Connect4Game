# Connect4Game
> This project was developed as part of an assignment I completed for my Software Enterprise: Personal Process and Quality class. The objective of this class was to  introduce software engineering, software lifecycle models, personal software processes for individual professionalism, time and defect estimation, yield and productivity, software testing and quality management.

This application utilizes JavaFX. To run the program, run Connect4TextConsole.java. From here, you will be able to access the GUI component of this application.
